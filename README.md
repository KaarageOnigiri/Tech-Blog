# About
This is Module 14 Challenge by the Ohio State University bootcamp. This project is about publishing a working blog site that allows users to sign in and create their own blog post, in addition to the ability to leave their comments on other users' posts.

## Description
This is a blog site that allows the users to freely discuss topics related to Tech. The user can create an account and make their own discussion post, and will be able to see new comments by others.

## Usage
When the user first enters the site, they can navigate around to look at the posts and comments, but in order to create new post or add new comment, they will first have to be logged in. If they don't have an account, they can sign up by clicking the sign up button and fill in their email, username, and password.
